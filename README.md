# Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Ground States of Quantum Spin Hamiltonian
*Code by Shah Saad Alam and Seth M. Davis*

Wrote Python Implementation of Resrticted Boltzmann Machines augmented with Variational Monte Carlo for Solving Quantum Spin Hamiltonians. 
For full documentation and project report, read attached pdf.

1. Code was tested for most ground states of the Hamitlonians.
2. Higher order corrections is a work in progress.
